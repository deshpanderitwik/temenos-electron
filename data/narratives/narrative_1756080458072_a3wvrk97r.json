And he agrees to take him in even though he has six sons and a wife to support. They live in a tiny little two-room shack, I guess, is what you would call it.</p><p>They had very little money to the point where all their clothes, including Li Lu's, had to be made by big mom, and the kids had to go out in the street and work. They had to feed themselves. They had to raise their own chickens. And so they would go, including Li Lu and other sons, would go out in the streets picking up tree branches for firewood and collecting thrown-away cabbage for the chickens.</p><p>He is in a terrible environment for anybody, much less a six-year-old. And so a lot of the neighbors are impoverished. There's a lot of drinking. One of their neighbors is drunk all the time and he beats on his wife. There is all kinds of violence. And so there's a fight that breaks out. And during this fight, somebody tells Li that your father is a spy.</p><p>And so this part is absolutely heartbreaking, imagine a six-year-old saying this to you. \"After the fight, big dad punished all of his sons except me. I cried and asked him, aren't you my dad, why did they say my dad is a spy? Are you a spy?\" Big dad said, \"I am your dad, just ignore what they said, but there's this other man,\" Li Lu says, \"I also call him bà.\" I said, \"Who is he? Is he a spy?\" He had spent so little time with his biological dad, he doesn't -- he's not even sure who is father is.\"My father and big dad had met in the coal mines.\" Big dad is a true friend to Li Lu's biological father.
